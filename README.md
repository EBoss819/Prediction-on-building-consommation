# Prediction-on-building-consommation
## Openclassroom project nÂ°4

This project is about consomation in building in Seattle. We have a bunch of building with their consomation data in order to use it as a train set to predict the consomation of futur building.
Multiple models were used to fit the best to the training set.

Notebook 1 is the one with featuring from existing CSVs.
Notebook 2 is the one with the different models.
